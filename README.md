# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a project on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. 
The project utilizes the **Logistic Regression** model, implemented in Python, to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Overview

Credit card fraud detection is an essential issue in the financial industry. 
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions, thereby minimizing financial losses.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a publicly available dataset, which includes transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. 
The dataset consists of 284,807 transactions, with only 492 being fraudulent, making it a highly imbalanced dataset.

- **Number of transactions:** 284,807
- **Number of fraudulent transactions:** 492
- **Features:** 30 numerical features, including `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class`.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and deal with class imbalance.
- **Model Training:** The logistic regression model is trained using the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/2208saiii/CodSoft_DS_Task2.git

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately X% on the test set. 
Detailed performance metrics are available in the notebook.

## Acknowledgements

- The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.
- Inspired by various open-source projects and tutorials on credit card fraud detection.
